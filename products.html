  <h2>Hemafuse</h2>

  <p>The Hemafuse is a manual autotransfusion device is that used to retransfuse a patient’s own blood during an internal hemorrhage, specifically ruptured ectopic pregnancies or road traffic accidents. The current procedure commonly used in Sub-Saharan Africa consists of salvaging blood with a kitchen soup ladle and filtering it with gauze. Compared to this soup ladle autotransfusion, Hemafuse takes 1/3 of the time, 1/9 of the staff, and is significantly safer. The Hemafuse functions much like a giant syringe to suction blood through a filter when a handle is pulled up. When the handle is pushed down the blood is transferred directly to a blood bag in a closed system.</p>

  <h2>(r)Evolve</h2>

  <p>The (r)Evolve is a modular centrifuge that can separate blood both with or without electricity in just 3 minutes. This allows the (r)Evolve to travel wherever the clinician does, from city to rural setting with just one device. Inability to perform blood separation is a key barrier towards diagnosis with the most commonly used diagnostic test in the rural developing world: a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). RDT’s are currently used for diseases including HIV, malaria, hepatitis, syphilis and typhoid fever. Blood separation can also extend the timeframe a clinician has to test a blood sample at room temperature from 2 hours to up to 3 days (Kodali, 2014).</p>
